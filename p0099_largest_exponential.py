# logic: convert everything to the same base, then just compare the exponents. Arbitrarily, I will
# convert everything to base two. For example,
# a^b = 10^x --> log a^b = x --> x = b log a
# i.e. if a^b > x^y then b log a > y log x
# this ^ inequality holds only because log is a monotonically increasing function
